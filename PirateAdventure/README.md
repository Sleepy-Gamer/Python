# Pirate-Adventure-Game

This is the second game I have made using python 2
It contains multiple files which are imported in when needed.
This game was done for task 45 in the book learn python the hard way.

The master file is called pirategame.py and the other files are scene extensions which are required for the game to function correctly.

I had several difficulties whilst creating this game. The first was getting return values from one file back into the master file so that the correct next scene could be selected. The second was a continous loop during the fight scene with the bear. I managed to sort these by researching and asking others on stackexchange and trying lots and lots of different ways. I had a lot of joy when they finally worked!

I plan on writing this game in C++ as a text based game and then moving on to writing it in C++ in unity and adding some graphics, I ma not sure how good these graphics will be but I am interested to learn the links between them and try my hand at several things.

Watch this space!

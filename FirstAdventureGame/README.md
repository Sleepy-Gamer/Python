First-Adventure-Game

This is the first game I made whilst working through the book learn Python the hard way. It is written in Python 2 and uses knowledge gathered from the chapters so far covered in the book. 

It is a fairly simple game using a different function per "room", these functions are called upon depending on user action. 
The biggest problem I encountered during the creation of this game was my creativity! I think perhaps I have been a bit mean and that they player dies too much. However as a first game written in Python I am fairly happy with it and look forward to branching out and learning more techniques.
